## Features

- 2 modes: Automatic and Manual
- Registration Quality: Multi-tiered and self-assessing automatic approach
- Automatic OCT B-scan overlay accounting for eye movements
- Overlapping OCT B-scans highlighted
- Microperimetry-style color-coded sensitivity map overlay
- User-editable Excel sheet: MAIA Test Point ID, MAIA Test Point Threshold (dB), Closest B-scan, Location of the MAIA Test Point ID from the start of the closest B-scan (pixels) and thickness of 10 retinal layers (Î¼m)

## Software Dependencies

The framework requires the following software:

- [MATLAB R2022b] - Programming & Numeric Computing platform
- [Fiji] - Open-source image processing package
- [OCT Explorer 3.8.0] - Open-source software for OCT image segmentation

## Installation  

1. Install MATLAB from the link provided above.
2. Install FIJI/ImageJ 1.54d from the link provided above.
3. Configure FIJI to work with MATLAB by adding it to the MATLAB path. Eg. If FIJI was installed on the Desktop, then add the following to the MATLAB path: C:\Users\RS\Desktop\fiji-win64\Fiji.app\scripts
